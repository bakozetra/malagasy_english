# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Repetition in the stylesheets, consider merging objects together to reuse declarations for different variants
2. console.logs / commented out code should not be in production
3. Component file names should be capitalized: ActionButton.js
4. Variable naming: Think about a person reading your code for the first time; it should be immediatly obvious to them what the variable is about. 

## Components

- Next button 4/5
- Action button 5/5
- Tool buttons 5/5
- Language Switcher 3/5
- Section Heading 5/5
- List item 5/5
- List 3/5
- Textarea 4/5
- U1 9/10
- U8 0/10
- U9 0/10
- Github workflow 8/10 // Pull requests and rebasing good, naming should be better (for example commit messages like "nothing changed" should not be used)
- No spelling mistakes: 4/5
- Clickup workflow: 3/3
- Use of screen navigation 5/5
- React Context: 5/5
- Reducer 0/5
- Clean Code: 7/10

Total 75/123 => 61%

You did a really good job at building the components and storybook! Areas you can improve in are speed (but this will come naturally) and variable naming (See the explanation above on how to approach this?) Looking forward to your next projects :)
